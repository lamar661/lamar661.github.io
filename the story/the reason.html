  <p>My first memory is me getting beat by my grandma for sitting down on the chair with plastic because she wanted it to be clean. Then the next memory is me going to the hospital with my mom and she left me in the lobby for a couple hours and came back crying. This was when my grandma died. My next memory is me going to the funeral home to say goodbye. This is when we had to move in with my grandpa because my aunt said she would help out with bills. Apparently from what my mom said I would call my grandma so she can make some grits and eggs because my mom wouldn't make it for me.</P>
  
  <p>But my aunt never helped with the bills and we were stuck in this bad house for 8 years. My granddad always would save me from getting beatings. Like this one time, I broke a window and I was about to get a beating but he told my mom not to and she did stop. me and my grandfather would sleep in the same room on different beds he was a best friend to me. sometimes I would go to my cousin house (in another state) she had a son that was also my cousin. I guess he had anger issues because he would beat me up. Not in a funny way, more like in an abusive way. One  time I got beat so bad I started to hyperventilate. I would be so hurt but when my mom came in he would stop and I would look fine. But then he moved to our city.
</p>
  
  <p>My next memory is the last words to my granddad. He came over to talk to my mom about something and then I said I love you as my last word. I was scared of not seeing him again and I didn’t but the day of when he passed away no one told me. I was getting paranoid about him passing away. The questions I was asking myself did he pass away and I said comments like please don't tell me that he passed away. Then I knew he passed away when my church members said, my grandpa's name.
</p>
<p>Later on that day I went to my best friend house. That's when my friend told me he passed away. I cried and Then I told him that my cousin was beating me up in an abusive way. During his funeral I had my best friend and my cousin(the bad one).My other cousin tak was crying and wouldn't get away from the casket and she started to live with me and started to take my money(i was only 11 or 12).later on that  week my mom kicked her out of the house. 1 year later she started to live with us again and  she was nasty and never washed. Then she tried to kill herself while she was pregnant. Some time later my best friends mom told my mom that i was being abused.Then my mom went straight to my cousin house and cussed them out while I was crying.  
</p>
    <p>At the end of 6th grade, I saw this movie named summer wars. This movie had a grandma that passed away and it made me cry. It made me think about my grandparents. Then the main character programmed or hacked the servers of a big company to save his friends family. It made me want to become a programmer.
In 7th grade I watch a lot of anime. My house was looking bad and made me feel depressed. In 8th grade It got so bad I started to watch anime to the point where I pulled all nighters because I didn't care. As the house worsen in 9th grade I was able to do better in school. Now i'm trying to to get my gpa up as high as I can. People told me I wasn't gonna make it in life or I wasn't gonna have a job when I grow up but I didn't care. Ever since then it was my dream to become a programmer for my grandparents. I won’t give up.</p>
